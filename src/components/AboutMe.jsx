              Hello! I'm Rayane Sefiani, a passionate and results-driven web
              developer from Morocco. With a solid foundation in front-end
              technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and a growing skillset
              in ReactJs, I specialize in building modern, responsive, and
              user-focused web applications.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              My journey into web development began at the age of 16, driven by
              a deep curiosity for how technology works and a desire to express
              creativity through code. Over the years, I've built several
              projects from To-Do List apps to interactive gamesâ€”each sharpening
              my ability to turn ideas into functional, polished websites.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Outside of coding, I enjoy learning about cars, exploring hardware
              and software, and constantly diving into new tech that inspires
              me.
